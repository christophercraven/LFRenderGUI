Blender exporter for Lightflow renderer

Lightflow was an unusual renderer when it was first released over 20 years ago. I still like it. Because this exporter script was written for Blender's 2.2x series, I modified it to work with Blender 2.49, the last version to sport the vintage interface. This script comes with no technical support, warranty or guarantee.

Lightflow is offered free for non-commercial use at lightflowtech.com by Jacopo Pantaleoni.

The original authors of this export script were Montz and Eeshlo. Based on reading from some of his old forum posts and blogs, I think Eeshlo did some intense work on this for many months. Eeshlo also worked on the original Yafray and an obscure QDune renderer, in addition to some contributions to Blender sourcecode. Consider this a bit of software archeology from Blender history.
